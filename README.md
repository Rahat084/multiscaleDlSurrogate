# A python tool to develop and deploy deep learning model from Molecular Dyanamic Simulation data to continuum models

A collection of scripts to work with the following softwares

LAMMPS : for data generation at the atomistic scale

TensorFlow : for training surrogate models on the atomistic scale data

FeniCS :  for deployment of surrogate models at continuum scale models
